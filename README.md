# Nixie tube clock
(name pending)

An old-and-busted DesignSpark project from many years ago. It's a fairly uninspired nixie tube clock using IN-12s. It currently has serious schematic and layout errors so I cannot recommend making it as-is. I'd like to fix it up and call it finished.

## Todo
- [ ] Port what I have to KiCad as best as possible.
- Fix broken stuff:
  - [ ] Switch-mode power supply needs to be redone.
- Reconsider some design choices:
  - [ ] How well does multiplexing nixies work? Is it a good idea?
  - [ ] PIC24FV32 may have been a decent choice 5 years ago, but no S/W was written to prove that. Maybe there's something better now?
  - [ ] Physical design needs work, consider the appearance of the final product.
